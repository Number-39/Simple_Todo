# Todo simple app

The application does not focus on the UI as much as the API. This was one of the challenges I face during the proceess of building the app. Since I only had three days to complete the project, I decided to focus on the logic and backend instead. The api that was provided to work on is not reliable because it does not add new tasks to its server nor it deletes the deleted tasks. However, the api requests are working as intended in the application. Another challege I faced was implementing a state managment technique. Due to the short time for building the app, I could not find time to implement a state management pattern too. With all these challenges, I worked towards implementing the api requests and the user login and logout autherization, with the ability to save the user's login to close and open the app without having to login again. As I mentioned, the user will not see new tasks added or deleted tasks because this problem is with the api provider.
